//! GNU Readline History API
//!
//! Many programs read input from the user a line at a time. The GNU History library is able to keep
//! track of those lines, associate arbitrary data with each line, and utilize information from
//! previous lines in composing new ones.
//!
//! The programmer using the History library has available functions for remembering lines on a
//! history list, associating arbitrary data with a line, removing lines from the list, searching
//! through the list for a line containing an arbitrary text string, and referencing any line in the
//! list directly. In addition, a history expansion function is available which provides for a
//! consistent user interface across different programs.
//!
//! The user using programs written with the History library has the benefit of a consistent user
//! interface with a set of well-known commands for manipulating the text of previous lines and
//! using that text in new commands. The basic history manipulation commands are similar to the
//! history substitution provided by csh.
//!
//! If the programmer desires, he can use the Readline library, which includes some history
//! manipulation by default, and has the added advantage of command line editing.
//!
//! Before declaring any functions using any functionality the History library provides in other
//! code, an application writer should include the file <readline/history.h> in any file that uses
//! the History library's features. It supplies extern declarations for all of the library's public
//! functions and variables, and declares all of the public data structures.
