//! [2.3.5 Searching the History List](https://goo.gl/Xltw2k)
//!
//! These functions allow searching of the history list for entries containing a specific string.
//! Searching may be performed both forward and backward from the current history position. The
//! search may be *anchored*, meaning that the string must match at the beginning of the history
//! entry.
