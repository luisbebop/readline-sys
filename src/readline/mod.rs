//! GNU Readline API
//!
//! This chapter describes the interface between the GNU Readline Library and other programs. If you
//! are a programmer, and you wish to include the features found in GNU Readline such as completion,
//! line editing, and interactive history manipulation in your own programs, this section is for
//! you.
//!
//! [2.1 Basic Behavior]
//! [2.1 basic behavior]: https://goo.gl/lGL9K0
//! Many programs provide a command line interface, such as mail, ftp, and sh. For such programs,
//! the default behaviour of Readline is sufficient. This section describes how to use Readline in
//! the simplest way possible, perhaps to replace calls in your code to gets() or fgets().
//!
//! The function `readline()` prints a prompt `prompt` and then reads and returns a single line of
//! text from the user. If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no prompt is displayed. The line
//! readline returns is allocated with malloc(); the caller should free() the line when it has
//! finished with it. The declaration for readline in ANSI C is:
//!
//! ```c
//!     char *readline (const char *prompt);
//! ```
//!
//! So, one might say
//!
//! ```c
//!     char *line = readline ("Enter a line: ");
//! ```
//!
//! in order to read a line of text from the user. The line returned has the final newline removed,
//! so only the text remains.
//!
//! If readline encounters an EOF while reading the line, and the line is empty at that point, then
//! ```(char *)NULL``` is returned. Otherwise, the line is ended just as if a newline had been
//! typed.
//!
//! If you want the user to be able to get at the line later, (with `C-p` for example), you must
//! call `add_history()` to save the line away in a history list of such lines.
//!
//! For full details on the GNU History Library, see the associated manual.
